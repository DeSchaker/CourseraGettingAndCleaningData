## Project description

This project transform raw data about smartphone usage to a tidy dataset.
To do this a r-script 'runAnalysis.R' was created which takes the following steps:

1. Download the zip file with the data, if it doesn't exist. Unzip the files in the zip file.
2. Create a list of needed files and read the needed dataframes from that files into a list of data frames.
3. Set readable column names
4. Combine the data frames in the list to a final date frame, which, according to specifications, contains only information about the subject,activity and the mean and standard deviaton values.
5. Create a tidy dataset with the averages for each variable per activity and subject.
